# Iplab_5
jupyter notebook for iplab at Tel-Aviv University 

## For this lab you will need to open the lab notebook in Colab:
[link to colab notebook]('https://colab.research.google.com/github/ophir91/Iplab_5/blob/master/Lab5.ipynb')
and save the file in __your__ Drive (__File --> 'save a copy in Drive'__).

Then make sure you are using GPU as describe above.

Now you will need to upload your image and the pretrained neural network (net.pth) from the lab folder:
